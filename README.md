# 🚑 Multi-Objective Ambulance Allocation Optimization

**A data-driven optimization framework for real-time citywide ambulance dispatch and base allocation.**

This MSc research project proposes a multi-objective model to balance emergency response time, ambulance utilization, and coverage across an urban landscape. The approach integrates real-time traffic, dynamic demand zones, and smart constraints to ensure effective and equitable emergency services.
